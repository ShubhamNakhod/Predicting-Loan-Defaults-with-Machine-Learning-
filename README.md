# Final-Project---German-Bank-Loan

Predicting Loan Default Through Machine Learning

Project Synopsis
The purpose of this study is to predict the probability that a client will default on a loan by utilising historical data from a German bank. 
The dataset contains several characteristics related to the consumer's financial history, employment position, and personal information.
The primary goal is to create and evaluate machine learning models that accurately predict loan defaults.

1) Data Cleaning and Exploration
Objectives: Recognise and handle any missing values, comprehend the structure of the dataset, and do exploratory data analysis (EDA) to look for trends.
Steps:
Open the dataset file called credit.csv.
Determine and assess the dataset's anomalies, inconsistencies, and missing values.
To investigate connections, trends, and important findings, use EDA.
Go over the key conclusions to get the data ready for feature engineering.


2) Engineering Features
Objective: Encode categorical variables, scale the data, and add new features to get it ready for modelling.
Steps:
Use the proper encoding methods (e.g., label encoding, one-hot encoding) to encode categorical variables.
Make new features that could improve the performance of the model.
To make sure that features are compatible with machine learning algorithms, scale or normalise them as needed.
Divide the data into testing and training sets in order to get ready to develop the model.


3) Model Building and Evaluation
Objective: The objective is to create, assess, and refine machine learning models in order to forecast loan defaults.
Steps:
Choose and use different machine learning models (such Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost).
Optimise the performance of the model by doing hyperparameter tuning (Grid search, Random search, etc.).
Utilising pertinent criteria (such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score), assess the models.
Determine which model performs the best using the evaluation metrics.


4) Reporting and Graphics
Objective: Showcase the model's performance and deliver the finished product.
Steps: 
To compare model performance, create plots and charts such as ROC curves and confusion matrices.
Display feature relevance and model predictions visually.
Note the conclusions and suggestions, stressing the advantages and disadvantages of the selected model.

Last Delivery
The project's introduction, methods, findings, discussion, and conclusion are all thoroughly summarised in the final report (final_report.pdf).
